NEW BUGSLEEP BACKDOOR DEPLOYED IN RECENT MUDDYWATER CAMPAIGNS
 July 15, 2024
Key Findings
MuddyWater, an Iranian threat group affiliated with the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), has significantly increased its activities in Israel since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023. This parallels with activities against targets in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, India and Portugal.
The threat actors consistently use phishing campaigns sent from compromised organizational email accounts. The phishing campaigns typically lead to the deployment of legitimate Remote Management Tools (RMM) such as Atera Agent and Screen Connect.
Recently, Muddy Water campaigns also led to the deployment of a new, previously undocumented tailor-made backdoor we dubbed BugSleep, that is used to target organizations in Israel.
BugSleep is a backdoor designed to execute the threat actors’ commands and transfer files between the compromised machine and the C&C server. The backdoor is currently in development, with the threat actors continuously improving its functionality and addressing bugs.
Introduction
MuddyWater, an Iranian threat group affiliated with the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), is known to be active since at least 2017. During the last year, MuddyWater engaged in widespread phishing campaigns targeting the Middle East, with a particular focus on Israel. Since October 2023, the actors’ activities have increased significantly. Their methods remain consistent, utilizing phishing campaigns sent from compromised email accounts targeting a wide array of organizations in countries of interest. These campaigns typically lead to the deployment of legitimate Remote Management Tools (RMM) such as Atera Agent or Screen Connect. Recently, however, they have deployed a custom backdoor we track as BugSleep.

In this report, we discuss the details of the most recent phishing campaigns and how they reflect the group’s interests. In addition, we provide an analysis of MuddyWater’s most recent techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) including the BugSleep custom backdoor and the abuse of Egnyte, a legitimate file-sharing service.

Emails and Lures
MuddyWater campaigns usually consist of sending large numbers of emails to a wide range of targets from a compromised email account. Although their lures are aimed at a large and varied set of organizations or individuals, they often focus on specific industries or sectors, highlighting the group’s points of interest. Among those are notable phishing campaigns aimed at Israeli municipalities as well as a broader group of airlines, travel agencies, and journalists. Overall, since February 2024 we identified over 50 spear phishing emails targeting more than 10 sectors that were sent to hundreds of recipients.

In each of these campaigns, the actors used a tailored lure that was sent to dozens of targets in the same sector. For example, lures aimed at municipalities contained a suggestion to download a new app created just for municipalities:

In more recent campaigns, the group shifted to more generic-themed, yet well-crafted phishing lures, such as invitations to webinars and online courses. This approach allows them to reuse the same lure across different targets and regions. Additionally, while they primarily used the locally spoken languages of their targets, they now use the English language more frequently.

This shift is exemplified in two different emails that use the same exact lure: one sent to targets in Saudi Arabia and the other to Israel. The main differences were the email addresses used to send them, and the final payload. In Saudi Arabia it was an RMM, and in Israel, the custom backdoor BugSleep.

Comparison of two emails about online courses using the same lure:

Characteristics of email	Version 1	Version 2
From	A compromised email account of a Saudi Arabian company.	A compromised email account of an Israeli company.
To	Companies in Saudi Arabia.	Companies in Israel.
Link	Email includes a direct link to an Egnyte subdomain.	Email contains a PDF attachment with an embedded link.
Payload	Atera RMM tool.	BugSleep backdoor.

Figure 3 – Email comparison (version 1 on the top).
The only differences in the content between the two emails are the company name and the last two lines with the link that can be found in the PDF attachment.

Attribution of these campaigns to MuddyWater is supported by the distinct patterns of behavior and RMM tools they employ, which have been consistently observed in their operations over the past few years.

BugSleep Infection Chain
The typical infection chain that delivers the BugSleep backdoor is as follows:

Egnyte Abuse
Egnyte is a secure file-sharing platform that allows employees and companies to easily share files via a web browser. Recently, MuddyWater has frequently used Egnyte subdomains, aligning them with the company names used in their phishing emails. Upon opening the shared link, recipients can see the name of the purported sender, which often appears legitimate, and matches the naming conventions of the targeted country.

In a link sent to a transportation company in Saudi Arabia, the displayed name of the owner was Khaled Mashal, the former head of Hamas and one of its prominent leaders.

BugSleep Technical Analysis
BugSleep is a new tailor-made malware used in MuddyWater phishing lures since May 2024, partially replacing their use of legitimate RMM tools. We discovered several versions of the malware being distributed, with differences between each version showing improvements and bug fixes (and sometimes creating new bugs). These updates, occurring within short intervals between samples, suggest a trial-and-error approach.

BugSleep main logic is similar in all versions, starting with many calls to the Sleep API to evade sandboxes and then it loads the APIs it needs to run properly. It then creates a mutex (we observed “PackageManager” and “DocumentUpdater” in our samples) and decrypts its configuration which includes the C&C IP address and port. All the configurations and strings are encrypted in the same way, where every byte is subtracted with the same hardcoded value.

In most BugSleep samples, the malware then creates a scheduled task with the same name as the mutex and adds the comment "sample comment” to it. The scheduled task, which ensures persistence for BugSleep, runs the malware and is triggered every 30 minutes on a daily basis.

BugSleep.

The malware communication is also encrypted the same way as its strings, adding 3 to every byte modulo 256. Every message exchanged between BugSleep and its C&C domain follows this format: [size_of_data][data].

BugSleep starts by sending the ID of the victim, consisting of the computer name followed by the username, formatted as [computer_name][username].

The malware has several commands it can perform based on the data sent from the C&C:

# Of Command	Arguments	Description
1	File name	Send a file content to C&C.
2	File name	Write content into a file.
3	Command	Run commands through cmd pipe until the command ‘terminate’.
4	Timeout value	Update ‘receive timeout’ by adding the new timeout value.
6	–	Stop communication.
9	–	Delete the persistence task.
10	–	Get the status of the persistence task.
11	–	Create the persistence task.
97	Sleep time	Update sleep time (not found in the first version).
98	Timeout value	Update the receive timeout (not found in the first version).
99	–	Sends the same value back (type of ping).
Evasions
In one of the malware versions, the developers implemented a couple of evasion methods from EDR solutions. First, the malware enables the MicrosoftSignedOnly flag of the ProcessSignaturePolicy structure to prevent the process from loading images that are not signed by Microsoft. This prevents other processes from injecting DLLs into the process.

Next, it enables the ProhibitDynamicCode flag of the ProcessDynamicCodePolicy structure to prevent the process from generating dynamic code or modifying existing executable code. Enabling ProcessDynamicCodePolicy may be useful for protecting it from EDR solutions that hook userland API functions to inspect programs’ intents.

BugSleep Loader
One of the samples we analyzed came with a custom loader. The loader injects a shellcode that loads BugSleep in-memory into one of the following processes, based on whether they are already running:

msedge.exe
opera.exe
chrome.exe
anydesk.exe
Ondedrive.exe
powershell.exe
The shellcode in this case is also encrypted with the same algorithm as the strings in BugSleep but with a different shift: every byte is subtracted with a hardcoded value of 6. After the decryption, the loader writes the shellcode inside the process with the WriteProcessMemory API and invokes the shellcode with the CreateRemoteThread API.

Bugs and Unused Code
Some of the samples contained several bugs, and parts of the code appear poorly written, with questionable omissions or additions that seem to be mistakes.

One of the samples checks if the file “C:\users\public\a.txt” exists and if it doesn’t, it creates the file which it later deletes. The purpose of this code is not entirely clear and may be unfinished code inserted by the authors or borrowed from other places without fully understanding what the code does.
In one sample, some of the API names were not encrypted like the others, probably due to lack of attention.
In some samples, instead of properly encrypting (adding 3 to each byte), the malware runs the decryption algorithm (subtracting each byte by 3), which is probably by mistake. In a newer sample, the malware authors fixed that bug but did not do the same for all of the commands. Another questionable action is that the malware decrypts the data after it’s sent. We assume that their intent was to encrypt the strings again so they would not be seen in memory, but in this case, it does the opposite.

Targets
According to our telemetry, these MuddyWater campaigns target a diverse array of sectors, ranging from government entities and municipalities to media outlets and travel agencies. While the majority of the emails was directed at companies in Israel, others were aimed at entities in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, India and Portugal.

In addition, files associated with the latest campaign were uploaded to VirusTotal from various IP locations, including Azerbaijan and Jordan. Notably, in the case of Azerbaijan, we can establish correlation with the target due to the Azerbaijani language used in the PDF lure.

Conclusion
The increased activity of MuddyWater in the Middle East, particularly in Israel, highlights the persistent nature of these threat actors, who continue to operate against a wide variety of targets in the region. Their consistent use of phishing campaigns, now incorporating a custom backdoor, BugSleep, marks a notable development in their techniques, tactics and procedures (TTPs).

The campaigns reflect the group’s interests, focusing on specific sectors such as municipalities, airlines, travel agencies, and media outlets. Although they are aimed at specific sectors, the nature of the lures themselves have become much simpler over time. The shift from highly customized lures to more generic themes such as webinars and online courses, combined with the increased use of the English language, allows the group to focus on higher volume rather than specific targets.
