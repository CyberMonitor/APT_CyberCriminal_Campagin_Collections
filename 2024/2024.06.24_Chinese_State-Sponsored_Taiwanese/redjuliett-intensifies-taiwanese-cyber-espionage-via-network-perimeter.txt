   Chinese State-Sponsored RedJuliett Intensifies Taiwanese Cyber
   Espionage via Network Perimeter Exploitation

   From November 2023 to April 2024, Insikt Group identified
   cyber-espionage activities conducted by RedJuliett, a likely Chinese
   state-sponsored group, primarily targeting government, academic,
   technology, and diplomatic organizations in Taiwan. RedJuliett
   exploited known vulnerabilities in network edge devices such as
   firewalls, virtual private networks (VPNs), and load balancers for
   initial access. The group likely operates from Fuzhou, China, aligning
   with its persistent targeting of Taiwan. RedJuliett’s activities likely
   aim to support Beijing's [22]intelligence collection on Taiwan’s
   economic and diplomatic relations, as well as critical technology
   development.

   Taiwanese Government, Academic, and Technology Sectors

   RedJuliett’s focus on targeting Taiwanese entities aligns with the
   group’s past activity. Insikt Group also observed RedJuliett expand its
   operations to compromise organizations in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Laos,
   South Korea, the United States, Djibouti, Kenya, and Rwanda.

   In addition to targeting vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices,
   RedJuliett also used structured query language (SQL) injection and
   directory traversal exploits against web and SQL applications.
   Organizations should complement routine patching with defense-in-depth
   strategies focused on detecting post-exploitation persistence,
   discovery, and lateral movement activity to counter these threats.
   Organizations should also regularly audit internet-facing devices and
   reduce their attack surface where possible. RedJuliett closely overlaps
   with public reporting under the aliases Flax Typhoon and Ethereal
   Panda.

   Key Findings
     * Victim Organizations: RedJuliett compromised 24 organizations,
       including government organizations in Taiwan, Laos, Kenya, and
       Rwanda. The group also conducted network reconnaissance or
       attempted exploitation against over 70 academic, government, think
       tank, and technology organizations in Taiwan, as well as multiple
       de facto embassies operating on the island.
     * Exploitation Techniques: RedJuliett created a SoftEther VPN bridge
       or client in victim networks. Additionally, the group conducted
       reconnaissance and attempted exploitation activity using Acunetix
       Web Application Security Scanners. RedJuliett also attempted SQL
       injection and directory traversal exploits against web and SQL
       applications. Post-exploitation, the group used open-source web
       shells and exploited an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the
       Linux operating system.
     * Infrastructure: RedJuliett administers operational infrastructure
       using SoftEther VPN, leveraging both threat actor-controlled leased
       servers and compromised infrastructure belonging to Taiwanese
       universities.
     * Implications for Taiwan: RedJuliett's activities align with
       Beijing's objectives to gather intelligence on Taiwan’s economic
       policy, trade, and diplomatic relations. The group also targeted
       multiple critical technology companies, highlighting the strategic
       importance of this sector for Chinese state-sponsored threat
       actors.

   Recommendations for Organizations

   Organizations likely to be targeted by RedJuliett should adopt the
   following measures:
    1. Network Segmentation: Practice network segmentation by isolating
       internet-facing services in a demilitarized zone (DMZ).
    2. Security Monitoring: Ensure security monitoring and detection
       capabilities for all external-facing services and devices. Monitor
       for follow-on activities such as the use of web shells, backdoors,
       or reverse shells and lateral movement within internal networks.
    3. Review Public Guidance: Review public guidance on mitigating common
       TTPs used by Chinese state-sponsored groups and Insikt Group’s
       [23]report on trends and recommendations for mitigating Chinese APT
       activity more broadly.
    4. Risk-Based Patching: Ensure a risk-based approach for patching
       vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and those
       being exploited in the wild, as identified by [24]Recorded Future
       Vulnerability Intelligence.
    5. Prioritize RCE Vulnerabilities: Focus on addressing remote code
       execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in popular VPN, mail server,
       firewall, and load-balancing appliances, particularly F5 BIG-IP,
       Fortinet FortiGate, and ZyXEL ZyWALL devices.
    6. Malicious Traffic Analysis: Monitor Malicious Traffic Analysis
       (MTA) to proactively detect and alert on infrastructure
       communicating with known RedJuliett command-and-control (C2) IP
       addresses.
    7. Monitor Supply Chains: [25]Use Recorded Future Third-Party
       Intelligence to monitor real-time output and identify suspected
       intrusion activities involving key vendors and partners.
    8. Threat Intelligence Extension: Install the [26]Recorded Future
       Threat Intelligence Browser Extension for instant access to threat
       intelligence from any web-based resource, enabling faster alert
       processing within security information and event management (SIEM)
       and prioritizing vulnerabilities for patching.

   Insikt Group anticipates that RedJuliett and other Chinese
   state-sponsored threat actors will continue to target Taiwan for
   intelligence-gathering, focusing on universities, government
   organizations, think tanks, and technology companies. Chinese
   state-sponsored groups are expected to continue their reconnaissance
   and exploitation of public-facing devices, a tactic that has proven
   effective in scaling their operations to gain initial access to a broad
   range of global targets.
