   During our monitoring of Earth Lusca, we noticed a new campaign that used Chinese-Taiwanese relations as a social engineering lure to infect selected
   targets.

Introduction

   Trend Micro previously published a number of entries discussing the operations of a China-linked threat actor we track as Earth Lusca. The group, which
   has been active since at least 2020 and has regularly changed its modus operandi, has been known to launch several different campaigns at the same time.

   During our monitoring of this threat actor, we noticed a new campaign that used Chinese-Taiwanese relations as a social engineering lure to infect
   selected targets. We attribute this campaign to Earth Lusca with high confidence based on the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) we observed in
   previous research.

   The attack campaign discussed in this report has likely been active between December 2023 and January 2024, with a file that contained a lure document
   discussing Chinese-Taiwanese geopolitical issues. This file was created just two days before the Taiwanese national elections and the document seems to
   be a legitimate document stolen from a geopolitical expert from Taiwan.

   Note that a recent leak of private documents provides a new attribution path to a Chinese company called I-Soon. We discuss these connections in a
   separate section in this entry. There is significant overlap between the victims, malware used, and probable location of Earth Lusca and I-Soon. This
   suggests, at the very least, a significant connection between these groups. Our research is continuing at this time.

Earth Lusca attack chain

   Figure 1. The infection chain used in the campaign

Initial access via spear phishing

   Although we were not able to determine the initial method Earth Lusca used to deliver infection files to its targets, we found the initial infection
   file, an archive (.7z) named China_s gray zone warfare against Taiwan.7z. Based on the threat actor's previous activities, we suspect this file was sent
   to the targets via email, either embedded as an attachment or as a link.

   The archive consists of a folder named "China's gray zone warfare against Taiwan" that contains two different Windows shortcut files (.LNK) and a
   subfolder named "__MACOS".
   Figure 2. The content of the 7-Zip archive

   The __MACOS subfolder name resembles the legitimate __MACOSX folder name created by macOS, which is hidden by default and is used to store each folder's
   various settings. In the case we analyzed, the __MACOS folder does not contain any metadata but instead hides another stage of the malicious payload.

   The __MACOS subfolder contains two files named "_params.cat.js" and "_params2.cat.js".

   All the files show metadata indicating that the files were last modified on Jan. 11, 2024.

First stage: Shortcut (LNK) file with hidden target attribute

   The LNK files, once selected, executes the JavaScript code stored in the __MACOS folder.

   If users attempt to right-click on the malicious LNK file and display its "target" parameter, they are presented only with an explorer.exe file name
   followed by space characters, as can be seen in Figures 3 and 4.

   Figure 3. Beginning (top) and end (bottom) of the "target" property field (space characters are in blue)

   The threat actor inserted 255 space characters in the "arguments" attribute before including the actual path to the malicious script to ensure that users
   don't notice anything is amiss.

   Tools such as LNK parser reveal the entire content of the "arguments" field:

   Figure 4. 255 space characters were used before the actual argument value.

Second stage: Obfuscated JavaScript file

   The second stage is obfuscated with Dean Edward's JavaScript Packer, a tool designed to obfuscate JavaScript code to hinder analysis and detections.

   Figure 5. Typical signature of Dean Edward's JavaScript Packer

Third stage: Deobfuscated JavaScript file and dropper

   The third stage drops a text file containing hexadecimal data to the %APPDATA%\Roaming directory.

   Figure 6. The text string with "4d534346 = MSCF" marker is written to a temporary file.

   This text file contains a magic signature, 4d534346, which is the Microsoft Cabinet File (MSCF) signature of a cabinet archive. The JavaScript then uses
   a living-off-the-land technique and calls a few LOLBins to decode a hexadecimal string to the binary file (certutil.exe) and unpack the cabinet archive
   (expand.exe).

   Figure 7. Content of cabinet archive

   The extracted cabinet archive contains a decoy file, a signed legitimate executable file, and a malicious DLL library.

   In the cases we observed, we found the decoy files to be either Microsoft Word documents, Microsoft PowerPoint documents, or PDF documents. Although
   these were written by professionals involved in political relations between China and Taiwan, we could not find any of these documents online. We suspect
   with moderate to high confidence that these documents were stolen from these authors or their employers. We have reached out to these individuals and
   organizations and warned themabout the possible compromise of their systems.

   The signed legitimate executable file, 360se.exe from Qihoo 360, was renamed to pfexec.exe by Earth Lusca in a case of DLL hijacking. Once executed, it
   launches the DLL contained in the same folder (chrome_elf.dll).

Fourth stage: Cobalt Strike stageless client (malicious obfuscated DLL library)

   The last stage of the infection chain is a stageless Cobalt Strike payload. The noteworthy parameters extracted from the embedded configuration are
   listed here:

   C2Server                         - upserver.updateservice.store,/common.html
   HttpPostUri                      - /r-arrow
   Watermark                        - 100000000

Similar attacks

   During the monitoring of this campaign, we received more archives using similar structures and employing comparable tricks but having different file
   names, decoy names, and command-and-control (C&C) servers, among others.

   One such noteworthy file, another 7z archive file named "ppt-cih1w4.7z", contained a folder named "Sino-Africa_relations" as seen in Figure 8:

   Figure 8. Content of the 7-Zip archive

   The folder also contained an LNK file and a __MACOS folder with payload, this time timestamped Dec. 22, 2023.

   Similar to the previously analyzed archive, several stages lead to this last stage (namely Cobalt Strike), only with different configurations. The C&C
   server name abuses the name of the cybersecurity company Cybereason. The malleable profile is also different this time and uses different URLs, although
   the watermark remains the same.

   C2Server                         - www.cybereason.xyz,/mobile-android
   HttpPostUri                      - /RELEASE_NOTES
   Watermark                        - 100000000

Attack started shortly before 2024

   As mentioned in the introduction, the campaign exposed in this report was likely active between December 2023 and January 2024, with the lure document
   created just two days before the Taiwanese national elections.

   The C&C domain used by Earth Lusca (updateservice[.]store) was registered anonymously on Dec. 12, 2023 and a subdomain was used for C&C communications
   (upserver.updateservice[.]store).

   Meanwhile, the other C&C domain used in this attack campaign (Cybereason[.]xyz) was registered anonymously on Oct. 27, 2023.

   Both C&C servers are unavailable as of this writing.

   We also found evidence that Earth Lusca targeted a Taiwan-based private academic think tank dedicated to the study of international political and
   economic situations.

   While we could not find other campaign targets at the time of writing, we suspect Earth Lusca might be planning to attack more politically related
   entities.

The I-Soon lead

   A recent leak on GitHub exposed sizeable data on a Chinese company called I-Soon that has seemingly been active since 2016. The company describes itself
   on its website as an "APT Defense and Research Laboratory" and provides descriptions of its services: offensive and defensive security, antifraud
   solutions, blockchain forensics solutions, security products, and more. The group also notes several law enforcement and government entities with which
   it collaborates. As an interesting aside, I-Soon had been the recipient of a few rounds of fundings since 2017. One of its investors was the antivirus
   company Qihoo from China --  which, as stated earlier, had an executable file abused for DLL hijacking.

   We found a few indicators in the I-Soon leak that made us believe that some of the Earth Lusca activities are similar to the contents of the leak:
    1. There is some victim overlap between Earth Lusca and I-Soon: Some of the names on the victim lists of the I-Soon leak were also victims of Earth
       Lusca's attacks.
    2. The malware and tools arsenal used by I-Soon and Earth Lusca has a few strong overlaps. Malware such as ShadowPad, Winnti and a few other tools have
       been used extensively by Earth Lusca and are used by i-Soon as well.
    3. We also discovered a location overlap between the two. In a blog entry in September 2023, we mentioned that Earth Lusca's source IP addresses are
       from Chengdu, Sichuan province, where the main office of I-Soon's penetration teams is also located.

Conclusion

    Earth Lusca remains an active threat actor that counts cyberespionage among its primary motivations. Organizations must remain vigilant against APT
   groups employing sophisticated TTPs. In particular, government organizations face potential harm that could affect not only national and economic
   security but also international relations if malicious actors were to succeed in stealing classified information. Meanwhile, businesses that fall prey to
   cyberespionage attacks might face a decline in customer trust and operational disruptions that in turn lead to financial repercussions.

   Given Earth Lusca's penchant for using email, resorting to social engineering as one of its main avenues of infection, and capitalizing on relevant
   social and political issues as seen in this campaign, we advise individuals and organizations to adhere to security best practices, such as avoiding
   clicking on suspicious email and website links and updating software in a timely manner to minimize the chances of falling victim to an Earth Lusca
   attack
