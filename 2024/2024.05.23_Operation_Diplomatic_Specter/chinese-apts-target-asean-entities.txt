ASEAN Entities in the Spotlight: Chinese APT Group Targeting

Executive Summary

   Over the past 90 days, Unit 42 researchers have identified two Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) groups conducting cyberespionage activities
   against entities and member countries affiliated with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN):
     * The first APT group, Stately Taurus, created two malware packages we believe targeted entities in Myanmar, the Philippines, Japan and Singapore. The
       timing of these campaigns coincided with the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit, held March 4-6, 2024.
     * The second Chinese APT group compromised an ASEAN-affiliated entity. This APT group has targeted various Southeast Asia government entities including
       Cambodia, Laos and Singapore in recent months.

   Stately Taurus (aka Mustang Panda, BRONZE PRESIDENT, Red Delta, LuminousMoth, Earth Preta and Camaro Dragon) has been operating since at least 2012. We
   assess this to be a Chinese APT group that routinely conducts cyberespionage campaigns. This group has historically targeted government entities and
   nonprofits, as well as religious and other nongovernmental organizations across North America, Europe and Asia.

   We recently identified network traffic from the aforementioned ASEAN-affiliated entity to the malicious infrastructure associated with the second Chinese
   APT group, which indicated the entity's environment had been compromised. ASEAN-affiliated entities are attractive targets for espionage operations due
   to their role in handling sensitive information regarding diplomatic relations and economic decisions in the region.

   Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from this malicious infrastructure through our Prisma Cloud Defender agents with WildFire integration,
   as well as DNS Security and Advanced URL Filtering.

Stately Taurus Activity

   During the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit held in March 2024, Unit 42 researchers identified two Stately Taurus malware packages that we assess were
   leveraged to target Asian countries. Threat actors created malware for these packages on March 4-5, 2024, coinciding with the ASEAN-Australia Special
   Summit (March 4-6, 2024).

Package 1: Talking_Points_for_China.zip

   Attackers created the first package on March 4, 2024, as a ZIP archive. Entities located in the Philippines, Japan and Singapore saw it the next day
   (evidenced by the samples they uploaded to communal databases). Extracting the contents of the Talking_Points_for_China.zip archive reveals two files, as
   shown in Figure 1.
   Image 1 is a screenshot of the contents of the ZIP file Talking_Points_for_China. it contains KeyScramblerIE dot DLL as well as the
   Talking_Points_for_China.exe. The first is an application extension and the second is an application. Figure 1. Talking_Points_for_China.zip.

   The executable Talking_Points_for_China.exe is actually a renamed copy of the signed anti-key logging program KeyScrambler.exe developed by QFX Software
   Corporation. Threat actors often abuse, take advantage of or subvert legitimate products for malicious purposes. This does not imply that the legitimate
   product is flawed or malicious.

   Upon executing this binary, it sideloads the malicious DLL KeyScramblerIE.dll and copies it to the directory
   C:\Users\Public\Libraries\SmileTV\KeyScramblerIE.dll with an autorun registry key of the same location established for persistence.

   The code then decrypts shellcode that we assess is PubLoad malware. This malware then attempts to establish a connection to 103.27.109[.]157:443.

   This package displays strong overlap with the sample described by CSIRT-CTI in their post's section entitled Campaign #4 - Talking Points for China.zip.
   These similarities include:
     * The archive filename
     * The magic bytes to initiate the payload (17 03 03)
     * Using a signed binary from QFX Software Corporation
     * The execution characteristics of PubLoad malware

Package 2: Note PSO.scr

   Threat actors created the second package on March 5, 2024, as a screensaver executable (SCR extension) file, which an entity located in Myanmar saw the
   same day (evidenced by an upload to a malware repository). Given the filename (Note PSO.scr), we suspect that PSO is likely a reference to the title of
   Personal Staff Officer, a rank in the Myanmar military.

   We observed Stately Taurus switching tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for this malicious package. Instead of their typical choice of relying on
   file archive formats (ZIP, RAR, ISO) for delivery, this time Stately Taurus employed an executable with a screensaver (SCR) file extension for initial
   infection. This approach resulted in the download of malicious code from the IP address 123.253.32[.]71.

   Upon opening the SCR file, the threat actor attempts to make network connections to download the benign executable WindowsUpdate.exe and malicious DLL
   EACore.dll. These files were hosted at the following locations:
     * hxxp[:]//123.253.32[.]71/WindowsUpdate.exe
     * hxxp[:]//123.253.32[.]71/EACore.dll

   Threat actors use a benign program they've renamed WindowsUpdate.exe, which is actually an older version of EACoreServer.exe signed by the reputable
   video game company Electronic Arts, Inc. They do this to give it an appearance of a trustworthy program while, in the background, they're sideloading
   their malicious DLL file that they've renamed to overwrite the legitimate EACore.dll. This malware then attempts to establish a connection to
   www[.]openservername[.]com at 146.70.149[.]36 for command and control (C2).

Second Chinese APT Group Activity

   We recently identified network connections between an ASEAN-affiliated entity and the C2 infrastructure of a Chinese APT group, indicating the entity's
   environment had been compromised. We have also observed similar activity originating from government entities across ASEAN member states.
   ASEAN-affiliated entities are attractive targets for espionage operations due to their role in handling sensitive information regarding diplomatic
   relations and economic decisions in the region.

C2 Infrastructure

   Table 1 outlines known target-facing infrastructure used for C2.

Activity Timeline: Second Chinese APT Group

   Unit 42 researchers identified threat actor activity throughout January and February 2024. We also observed a distinct lull coinciding with the Lunar New
   Year and the Chinese mandated "Special Working Day" on Feb. 18, 2024, as shown in Figure 2.
   Image 2 is a timeline of the working days observed identifying the threat actor from the end of January to the end of February. The threat actors are
   active Monday through Friday, do not work much during the Lunar New Year or the Special Working Day, and then resume activity. Times are in China
   Standard Time. Figure 2. Pattern of life: working days.

   We observed a similar pattern of life with this same actor during China's Golden Week in September and October 2023.

   Working hours for this actor were also consistent with our prior observations of business hours on weekdays (Monday to Friday) adjusted to UTC +08:00
   (China Standard Time), as shown in Figure 3.
   Image 3 is a heat map of the pattern of life adjusted to China Standard Time. The vertical axis lists the days of the week starting with Monday at the
   top and ending with Sunday. The horizontal axis lists the hours by military time. The heat map is fades from not working dark purple) to green-yellow as
   the threat actors work between Monday and Friday from 8:00 AM to 17:00 PM. Figure 3. Pattern of life: working hours (+08:00 time adjusted).

Conclusion

   Unit 42 has identified two Chinese APTs conducting recent cyberespionage activities against the entities and member countries affiliated with the
   Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). These types of campaigns continue to demonstrate how organizations are targeted for cyberespionage
   purposes, where nation-state affiliated threat groups collect intelligence of geopolitical interests within the region. We encourage organizations to
   leverage our findings to inform the deployment of protective measures to defend against these types of threats.
